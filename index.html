		<h2>Relationships</h2>
		<p>Darth Bane considered few beings to be his friends. As a Sith Lord, he was driven by a desire for power and saw everyone, including potential allies, as mere tools to be used in his quest for domination. He was particularly dedicated to the idea of the survival and growth of the Sith Order, and saw anyone who posed a threat to that goal as an enemy to be defeated. One exception to this may have been his apprentice, Zannah, who he took under his wing and trained in the ways of the Sith. However, even with Zannah, it is unlikely that he considered her a true friend, but instead as a valuable asset in his plan to secure the future of the Sith. Click the link to learn about Zannah:</p>
